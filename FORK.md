# Mooncake Replicate

This repository was originally forked from [supabase/pg_replicate](https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate) at commit `d56409774c9ef89f993dc0032d24d36bad943612`.

It has since diverged substantially. We maintain this repo as part of the Mooncake stack.

Major changes include:

- Tight integration with Moonlink
- Pruned unused sinks and scaffolding
- Plans to support Logical Replication v2 (Postgres 15+)
